<h3> Flight Delay Prediction </h3>

<h2> 1.1 General Info </h2>
A flight delay is when an airline flight takes off and/or lands later than its scheduled time. 
In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration estimates that flight delays cost airlines $22 billion yearly. This is largely because airlines are forced to pay federal authorities when they hold planes on the tarmac for more than three hours for domestic flights or more than four hours for international flights. 

Hence, Predicting when a flight might get delayed would be an advantage to the airline industry that they can be well aware of the situation early and will help them in reducing the cost of it.

<h2> 1.2 What is the problem? </h2>
  The airline industry is vast and all the airline companies would like to be profitable always( Like everyother company). But managing an airline comes with its own problems and technical difficulties. 
  
   One of the major problem that they encounter is flight delay, this might seem like a small issue for a customer but for the airline company, it comes with a cost. The problem is that they rarely get to know beforehand, if the flight is going to get delayed or not. There is a lot of factors which is not in their hand ( bad weather, bird strikes, runway damage etc).
   
   But they can atleast be well prepared with the historical and live data that they possess which can be used to create a Classification model which can predict if a flight is going to be delayed or not due to some predictor variables.
 

<h2> 1.3 Interested Party and Reason </h2>
   The intended party would be any airline company like Qatar,American Airlines, Southwest or many othere. This model will be very useful to them as it will be a cost saving solution to them. A few more advantages are listed below,
    

 Advantages of having a ML model with Flight delay prediction powers:
  >- The Airline company will have a fair idea about if a flight might get delayed or not.
  >- Based on the above information, the company can take appropriate actions in order to save money like they can schedule the parking time in the airport for a lesser rate (The cost of parking an aeroplane in the airport is very very high).
  >- The model maybe used to evaluate a pattern in the delayed flights. For example, multiple flights can be delayed due to bad weather in a certain season every year, then the airline company can decide how to take care of this problem.
  >- Based on the results, the airline company could also tell the passengers about the situation well in advance and keep their expectations right.
